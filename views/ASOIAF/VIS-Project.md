# Group A_ASOIAF_VIS Project
This visualization project is about [*A Song of Ice and Fire*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire), a series of epic fantasy novels by the American novelist and screenwriter [*George R. R. Martin*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_R._R._Martin). We hope to do some visualization of ASOIAF instead of instead of its adaption TV series [*Game of Thrones*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones), which is the target of most related visualizations. What's more, we also would like to use some data mining algorithms to explore the data we extract from the text, trying to get some new observations and interesting insights of the novel.
