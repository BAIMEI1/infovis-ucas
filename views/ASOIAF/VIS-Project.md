# Group A_ASOIAF_VIS Project

## Visualization Data and Task Scenario (Checkpoint I)

This visualization project is about [*A Song of Ice and Fire*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire), a series of epic fantasy novels by the American novelist and screenwriter [*George R. R. Martin*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_R._R._Martin). We hope to do some visualization of ASOIAF instead of instead of its adaption TV series [*Game of Thrones*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones), which is the target of most related visualizations. What's more, we also would like to use some data mining algorithms to explore the data we extract from the text, trying to get some new observations and interesting insights of the novel.

Here are some details of our project:

### Data

We will firstly try to obtain the frequency of the emergence of every characters and places in each [POV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narration) chapters by some basic text processing techniques. The dataset we hope to acquire will contain a n-by-p matrix X with n characters and places and p chapters collected from the novel. Each element contains either 0 or m indicating if the frequency of character's or place's appearance in the POV chapter.
